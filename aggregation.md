To extract information on neighborhood-level indicators, we assessed information on all people residing in Denmark on December 31 annually from 1981 to 2016. The population was divided into data zones that were nested within the 98 Danish municipalities. For each year, we first extracted information on individual-level covariates for all Danish residents on December 31. Thereafter, individual-level/household-level covariates were aggregated by data zone and year to calculate data zone-level constructs. Depending on the setting, we calculated the proportion of individuals (PI) or the proportion of households (PH). Unless noted otherwise we used the full population for calculation the data zone-level constructs.

To reduce uncertainty of neighborhood level covariates, in the associated paper we used the mean of each neighborhood level construct from 1981 to 1984. A few constructs were based on other periods due to lack of historical data: no car owned (2003-2009), rented accommodation (2000-2009), Charlson Comorbidity Index (1987-1989), violent offending (1991-1999), any criminal offending (1991-1994).

For later reference, presented online are all neighborhood level constructs in approx. five year bands from 1981 to 2014 varying according to availability and sensitivity of data.
