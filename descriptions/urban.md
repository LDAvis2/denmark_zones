Urbanicity was categorized according to each cohort memberâ€™s residential address: capital, capital suburb, provincial city with more than 100,000 inhabitants, provincial town, and rural area. This classification was based on the 270-level classification of municipalities in 2006, and do not completely nest within the 98-level classification of municipalities. To ensure that urbanicity was nested within the 98-level municipality structure, urbanicity was redefined as the most frequent original urbanicity measure among people residing within each data zone at December 31, 2005. Around 5.5% of people had their urbanicity redefined. Sensitivity analyses show identical effects of original and modified urbanicity classification on schizophrenia risk. This information was available from 1978 onwards.
